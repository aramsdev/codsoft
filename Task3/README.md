In this project, you can get a basic Student Management System developed in Java with Swing. 

In the system you will be able to manage the collection of students. You can add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.

We use Swing to get a more user friendly interface. It's not the best but it works.

All the students will be on a Database named School in a table called Students.
